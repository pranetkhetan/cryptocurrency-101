# cryptocurrency-101
 code for cryptocurrency-101.github.io (Created by Pranet Khetan, on a different account because of how Github Pages hosting worked at the time) <br> <br>

 was made for a school assembly presentation on cryptocurrency (so i thought i could distil all the information on a website for later use). <br>
 some of the information on this website is hilariously outdated <br> 
 Made with HTML and CSS. every element has been painstakingly positioned with CSS (because i didnt know how to use bootstrap at the time lol) <br>

 made in 2021
